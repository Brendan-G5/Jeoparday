This app was created using create-react-app and local storage to hold the data.  The charts were made with C3 and react-c3js. Quesitions and answers come from the jService API.

To Demo the app, clone the repo and run npm start from the root directory. You can then play your first day of Jeoparday! (Getting the chrome extension will be easier once it is up)
